# Roll the Dice Game
This is a simple Python implementation of the "Roll the Dice" game. In this game, a dice with six faces is rolled, and a random number between 1 and 6 is obtained. The game allows the user to roll the dice repeatedly as desired.

# Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can : <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download Python from the official website</a>


# Implementation
The game is implemented using the random module in Python, which provides functions for generating random numbers. Two functions, `randint()` and `choice()`, are used in this implementation.

# Rolling Dice using the randint() Function
The randint() function is used to generate a random integer within a specified range. In this case, we use it to generate a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a six-sided dice. The function takes the minimum value and maximum value of the range as input arguments.

# Repeated Rolling
The game allows the user to roll the dice repeatedly. This is achieved using a while loop. After each roll, the user is asked if they want to roll again. If the user inputs `"yes"` or `"y"`, the loop continues, and another roll is performed. If the user inputs any other value, the loop exits, and the game ends.

# Usage
To play the "Roll the Dice" game, follow these steps:

# Run the Python script.
1. The script will generate a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a dice.
2. The generated number will be displayed to the user.
3. The user will be prompted to roll the dice again by entering `"yes"` or `"y"` if they wish to continue.
4. Steps 2-4 will be repeated as long as the user wants to roll the dice again.
5. When the user decides to stop rolling, the game will end.
